            (SimpleConstraint) or 1.
            - If the constraint type already exists, the index set of
            this should be one-dimensional. This is for example the case
            if the respective constraint type has been generated by this
            function.
            - For adding parameters, always use the same index set

        parameter types that already exist in the initial model
        definition. It may work in some cases, but this can not be
        guaranteed for any case.

        Exact effect on Pyomo model object:
            - If the constraint type does not exist yet, it will be
            created as an IndexedConstraint object with an underlying
            one-dimensional index set.

            - Each added constraint will get a new, unique
            one-dimensional index within the constraint type.

            - For parameters, that do not contain the index set of the
            given constraints, any of the parameters get an additional
            constraint index at their first position. The same holds if
            the constraints have no index set (SimpleCons).
            (Examples: p becomes p[consindex],
            p[varindex] becomes p[consindex, varindex])

            - For parameters, that contain the index set of the given
            constraints, this parameter index is replaced by the new
            unique constraint index.
